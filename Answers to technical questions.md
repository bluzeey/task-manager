### How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent around 3-4 hours at max on the coding test.

### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
I would say that one of the most useful features which have added to React is rendering server side components. I haven't particularly used it in the task management application since the complete logic is client based. 
Here is the site with all that logic for different use cases.

### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Yes, there are times where I have had to track performance issues. And I would say that one of the ways that I try to resolve them if they are in the latest build, is to scope out the code which might have had the code related to the error, and trying to resolve and understand what is causing the error. And pushing the hotfix for the same. 

### If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
I would add a feature for organizing tasks under different directories since that is something which is really handy. 
And probably adding some sort of gamification features to make user be more willing to use the application.
